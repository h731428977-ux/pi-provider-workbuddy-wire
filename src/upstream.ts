/**
 * WorkBuddy upstream regions, gateways and wire constants.
 *
 * Endpoint and wire behaviour follow the measured protocol documented in
 * dingminhua/dsh-connect-workbuddy (MIT), which itself credits
 * corrinehu/dsh-workbuddy-connect and Sliverkiss/workbuddy2api (both MIT).
 *
 * Key measured facts this module encodes:
 *
 * - Two regions: CN (`copilot.tencent.com`) and Global (`www.workbuddy.ai`,
 *   whose tokens are ALSO issued at `www.codebuddy.ai` — two brand domains,
 *   one gateway stack; a token issued at one domain is refused by the other).
 * - The model catalog lives at `/v3/config` and answers a DIFFERENT document
 *   per client channel. The CLI channel's answer is a strict subset of the
 *   app channel's and publishes neither `modelPromotions` nor `modelTiers`,
 *   so catalogs are read with the app's product UA while CHAT is sent with
 *   the CLI UA (the channel the conversation identity is bound to).
 * - CN falls back to the legacy `/v2/enterprises/personal/models` when
 *   `/v3/config` fails; the global gateway only answers `/v2` there (its
 *   `/console` spelling returns 500) — both regions use `/v2` as fallback.
 * - Credits (read-only, no cost) live at the billing base:
 *   CN `https://www.codebuddy.cn/v2/billing/meter/get-user-resource`;
 *   global accounts read their own gateway.
 * - Chat is `/v2/chat/completions`, OpenAI-compatible, `stream: true` forced,
 *   `tool_choice` flattened to a string, `developer` rewritten to `system`.
 * - Token refresh is `/v2/plugin/auth/token/refresh` with `X-Refresh-Token`
 *   (the ONLY place the refresh token travels).
